        <p>I hope to one day write about my investment principles. However, management principles are now what we need most, so here are the ones that I think make sense and have worked for me.</p>
<p>将来的某一天可能会做一些其他我感兴趣的事情,现在做的是我最需要的并且为我工作的东西!</p>
<p>Your values are what you consider important!Principles connect your values to your actions; they are beacons that guide your actions, and help you successfully deal with the laws of reality. It is to your principles that you turn when you face hard choices.</p>
<p>你的价值是你认为什么重要,原则就像一个灯塔指引着你行动的方向,尤其是在面对艰难选择时会起很大的作用!<br><a id="more"></a><br>Without principles, you would be forced to react to circumstances that come at you without considering what you value most and how to make choices to get what you want. This would prevent you from making the most of your life. </p>
<p>没有原则你就响应周围的环境时就不会去想对于你来说什么最有价值做什么样的决定能够让你得到你想要的,没有原则会阻止你得到最多在你的生活中.</p>
<p>adopting pre-packaged principles without much thought exposes you to the risk of inconsistency with your true values. Holding incompatible principles can lead to conflict between values and actions.Your principles need to reflect values you really believe in.</p>
<p>去适应那些系统的原则而不去想太多的风险在于和你真正认为重要的事情冲突不能持久,去使用这些不兼容的原则将会让你和你认为重要的事情和你的行动之间有冲突,你的原则一定要是你认为什么重要并且你真的确信.</p>
<p>When you enter into relationships with other people, your and their principles will determine how you interact. People who have shared values and principles get along. People who don’t will suffer through constant misunderstanding and conflicts with one another.</p>
<p>和周围的人共事和他们分享自己的原则和自己人为什么事情更重要,会让你免于陷入别人的不理解和冲突之中</p>
<p>Those principles that are most valuable come from our own experiences and our reflections on those experiences. Every time we face hard choices, we refine our principles by asking ourselves difficult questions.</p>
<p>最有价值的原则应该是来自于我们自己的经历和对自己经历的反省,每次我们面对艰难地选择我们都可以精进我们的原则通过问自己困难的问题.</p>
<p>But to be most effective, each principle must be consistent with your values, and this consistency demands that you ask: Why?To be successful, you must make correct, tough choices. You must be able to “cut off a leg to save a life,”</p>
<p>最有效的每个原则和你认为什么事情最重要一致时才能持久,你要一直问自己为什么这件事更重要!为了得到更多你就要去做正确并且艰难的选择,你一定要有砍腿救命的勇气.</p>
<p>I couldn’t get excited about forcing myself to remember what others wanted me to remember without understanding what all this work was going to get me. In order to be motivated, I needed to work for what I wanted, not for what other people wanted me to do. And in order to be successful, I needed to figure out for myself how to get what I wanted, not remember the facts I was being told to remember.</p>
<p>我不能变得兴奋如果让我强行去记一些我并不理解的东西！为了让我变得更积极我必须让自己为自己想要的东西去工作,而不是别人想让我去做!为了得到我想要的东西我必须搞明白怎样去得到我想要的东西,而不是去让自己去记住一些事实.</p>
<p>learn about how difficult it is to be right and the costs of being wrong.</p>
<p>学习到要想正确是多么的艰难,错误的代价是多么的惨重.</p>
<p>Most people come up with opinions and there’s no cost to them. Not so in the market. This is why I have learned to be cautious.</p>
<p>很多人总是抛出一些观点但他们自己却不去做,这让我学习一些东西的时候更加谨慎.</p>
<p>I worked for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do.For that reason, I never felt that I had to do anything. All the work I ever did was just what I needed to do to get what I wanted. Since I always had the prerogative to strive for what I wanted, I never felt forced to do anything.</p>
<p>我工作是因为我自己想做而不是别人想让我去做,基于这个原因我从来不觉得什么事情是我必须做的,我做的任何工作都是我要去得到我想要的东西必须要做的.所以我总是有特权去追寻什么是我想要的,我从来不觉得我是被强制做一些事情.</p>
<p> So I ordered all the annual reports and worked my way through the most interesting ones and formed opinions  about which companies were exciting</p>
<p>我订阅了财富杂志每年的报告找一个最感兴趣的让我兴奋的去研究形成自己独立的观点.</p>
<p>I stress-tested my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong.</p>
<p>我去和那些最聪明的人去验证自己的观点，他们对我的观点提出挑战能让我发现我在哪里做错了!</p>
<p>I never cared much about others’ conclusions—only for the reasoning that led to these conclusions. That reasoning had to make sense to me. Through this process, I improved my chances of being right, and I learned a lot from a lot of great people.</p>
<p>我不太关心别人给出的结果只关心得出这个结论的过程,如果这个得出结论的过程被我认可,我也能提高我正确的机会,我能从那些厉害人物身上学到很多.</p>
<p>I dealt with my not knowing by either continuing to gather information until I reached the point that I could be confident or by eliminating my exposure to the risks of not knowing. </p>
<p>我处理我不知道的事情就是一直增加信息直到我能理解它,去剔除一些未知的暴露的风险.</p>
<p>I wrestled with my realities, reflected on the consequences of my decisions, and learned and improved from this process.</p>
<p>我和现实去搏斗,根据我做的决定得出的结果去反省,在这个过程学习和提高.</p>
<p>because I could learn about things that interested me; I studied because I enjoyed it, not because I had to.</p>
<p>我学习一些东西是因为它能吸引我,我学习一些东西是因为我享受这个过程,而不是我必须要这样做.</p>
<p>At that time the Beatles had made a trip to India to learn how to meditate, which triggered my interest, so I learned how to meditate. It helped me think more clearly and creatively, so I’m sure that enhanced my enjoyment of, and success at, learning.</p>
<p>那时披头士去印度学习冥想这勾起了我的兴趣,所以我也去学习冥想它能帮助我更清晰更有创造性的的思考,我确信它能让我更加快乐,享受,也能更好地帮助我去学习.</p>
<p>the place was even better than I expected because the case study method allowed open-ended figuring things out and debating with others to get at the best answers, rather than memorizing facts.</p>
<p>这个地方超出了我的预期这个时机让我学习了一些方法,打开自己的思路去搞明白一些事情并且能够和其他的人去辩论得到更好的答案,而不是去记住一些事实.</p>
<p>I learned that failure is by and large due to not accepting and successfully dealing with the realities of life.</p>
<p>我学到了失败很大程度上源于不去接受一些事实,成功源于对现实生活的处理.</p>
<p>I learned that finding out what is true, regardless of what that is, including all the stuff most people think is bad—like mistakes and personal weaknesses—is good because I can then deal with these things so that they don’t stand in my way.</p>
<p>我学到了去找出什么是真的不管它是什么,包括大多数人认为不好的像犯错误和个人的缺点，犯错误和自己的弱点对我来数是很好的因为我能很好的处理它们,所以他们不会成为我的阻碍!</p>
<p>Being truthful, and letting others be completely truthful, allows me and others to fully explore our thoughts and exposes us to the feedback that is essential for our learning.</p>
<p>保持真实其他人也会变得真实,允许自己和其他人看到自己真正的想法去坦诚自己去获得反馈,使我们很重要的组成部分.</p>
<p>critical of others—that they won’t test by speaking to the relevant people about them. Instead, they talk behind people’s backs, which leads to pervasive misinformation. I learned to hate this because I could see that making judgments about people so that they are tried and sentenced in your head, without asking them for their perspective, is both unethical and unproductive.  So I learned to love real integrity .</p>
<p>去指责别人而不是和 相关的人去证实,相反在背后议论别人将会错失很多的信息,这是很让人讨厌的因为我想很公正的去看待一个人而不是尝试评判一个人在自己脑子里没有去问当事人的看法,那是不道德并且没有效果的,所以我去爱真正的诚实.</p>
<p>I learned that there is an incredible beauty to mistakes because embedded in each mistake is a puzzle, and a gem that I could get if I solved it, i.e., a principle that I could use to reduce my mistakes in the future. I learned that each mistake was probably a reflection of something that I was (or others were) doing wrong, so if I could figure out what that was, I could learn how to be more effective. I learned that wrestling with my problems, mistakes, and weaknesses was the training that strengthened me. Also, I learned that it was the pain of this wrestling that made me and those around me appreciate our successes. </p>
<p>犯的每一个错误里面都有一个你困惑的东西,它就好像是一个宝石如果你能找到并且能够解决它！原则能够帮助你少犯很多错误在将来,每个错误的出现是在提醒我某个地方我做错了,如果我能弄明白导致错误的根源是什么我就能学一些东西更加高效,我学着和我的问题犯的错误,我的弱点就行搏斗的时候那也是在训练我让我变得更加巩固.另外搏击产生的痛苦也让我更加欣赏自己的成功.</p>
<p>is an inaccurate picture of the typical successful person. I met a number of great people and learned that none of them were born great—they all made lots of mistakes and had lots weaknesses—and that great people become great by looking at their mistakes and weaknesses and figuring out how to get around them. So I learned that the people who make the most of the process of encountering reality, especially the painful obstacles, learn the most and get what they want faster than people who do not. I learned that they are the great ones—the ones I wanted to have around me.</p>
<p>那并不是一个我们常见的一个人成功的方式,我见过很多有大成就的人他们没有一个生来伟大的,他们中所有的人都犯过很多错误也有很多的弱点,伟大的人之所以变得伟大是因为他们寻找自己的弱点和错误并把他们搞明白能够去搞定它们,我慢慢了解到人们要去处理遇到的现实问题,尤其是痛苦和挣扎,他们能更快的得到他们想要的东西相对于那些遇到错误不处理不去搞定自己弱点不去面对现实中痛苦的人.</p>
<p>While most others seem to believe that learning what we are taught is the path to success, I believe that figuring out for yourself what you want and how to get it is a better path. </p>
<p>很多人坚信学习好我们被教育的东西是通往成功的路径,我笃信先搞明白什么是你想要的,怎么去得到它是一个更好的路径.</p>
<p>While most others seem to believe that having answers is better than having questions, I believe that having questions is better than having answers because it leads to more learning. </p>
<p>很多人认为一个好的答案要好于去问一些问题,我笃信一个好的问题要好于得到一个答案,因为那能让我们学到更多的东西.</p>
<p>While most others seem to believe that mistakes are bad things, I believe mistakes are good things because I believe that most learning comes via making mistakes and reflecting on them.</p>
<p>很多人认为犯错误是一件很糟糕的事情,我相信犯错误是一件好的事情,我们能够通过错误和对错误的反省学到最多的东西.</p>
<p>While most others seem to believe that finding out about one’s weaknesses is a bad thing, I believe that it is a good thing because it is the first step toward finding out what to do about them and not letting them stand in your way.While most others seem to believe that pain is bad, I believe that pain is required to become stronger. </p>
<p>很多人认为被人发现自己的缺点是一件很糟糕的事情,我相信那是一件好事情因为去面对弱点是让它不成为你的阻碍的第一步.很多人认为痛苦是不好的,但我知道痛苦是让我们变强壮的必要条件.</p>
<p>What I wanted was to have an interesting, diverse life filled with lots of learning—and especially meaningful work and meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>我想要的是能够有一个兴趣驱使我去进行大量的学习,另外还有有意义的工作和有意义的关系.</p>
<p>I found that if I accepted the realities rather than wished that they didn’t exist and if I learned how to work with them rather than fight them, I could figure out how to get to my goals.</p>
<p>我发现我能接受现实而不是去假装它并不存在,我学着如何和他们一起工作而不是去和他们搏斗,我能想明白怎样去实现我自己的目标.</p>
<p>The people who really change the world are the ones who see what’s possible and figure out how to make that happen. </p>
<p>那些真的能够改变世界的人他们真的知道存在那种可能并且能够搞明白怎样让那件事情发生.</p>
<p>some of which are practical and others of which are impractical. This perspective gives me a non-traditional sense of good and bad: “good,” to me, means operating consistently with the natural laws, while “bad” means operating inconsistently with these laws.In other words, for something to be “good” it must be grounded in reality. </p>
<p>关于一个东西是好的还是坏的一个重要的维度是它是不是可操作,这个观察让我对好的和坏的有了一种新的看法,好的对我来说就是能够持续操作下去的符合自然地规则,坏的就是不可持续不符合自己的规则,换种说法也就是说好的一定要扎根于现实的.</p>
<p>I believe that the desire to evolve, i.e., to get better, is probably humanity’s most pervasive driving force.</p>
<p>我坚信每一个人都渴望去进化变得更好,这可能是人类最普遍的一种驱动力.</p>
<p>In other words, the sequence of 1) seeking new things (goals); 2) working and learning in the process of pursuing these goals; 3) obtaining these goals; and 4) then doing this over and over again is the personal evolutionary process that fulfills most of us and moves society forward.</p>
<p>换言之这个顺序应该是:寻找一个新的目标—&gt;通过投入和学习在这个过程中去实现目标——&gt;实现这些目标——&gt;然后一遍一遍做这些事情完成个人进化的过程会让我们得到更多从而推动社会的前进.</p>
<p>Self-interest and society’s interests are generally symbiotic: more than anything else, it is pursuit of self-interest that motivates people to push themselves to do the difficult things that benefit them and that contribute to society.</p>
<p>自己的兴趣和社会的需要通常是可以共生的,跟随自己的兴趣更够让自己更加积极的搞定很多困难不但对他们自己有好处对社会也会有贡献.</p>
<p>In return, society rewards those who give it what it wants. That is why how much money people have earned is a rough measure of how much they gave society what it wanted—NOT how much they desired to make money. Look at what caused people to make a lot of money and you will see that usually it is in proportion to their production of what the society wanted and largely unrelated to their desire to make money. There are many people who have made a lot of money who never made making a lot of money their primary goal. And there are many people who really wanted to make a lot of money but never produced what the society wanted and they didn’t make a lot of money. In other words, there is an excellent correlation between giving society what it wants and making money, and almost no correlation between the desire to make money and how much money one makes. </p>
<p>作为回报,社会将回报给这些他想要的给他,这就是可以粗略的去测量一个人给予了多少社会想要的他就能能挣多少钱,而不是他想挣多少钱.去寻找那些人挣钱的原因你就会发现他们多大程度上给社会提供了想要的价值,最不相关的就是他对挣钱有多么的渴望,那些挣大钱的人从来都不把挣钱当做他的根本目标,整天想着要挣大钱却没有给社会提供价值的人他是挣不到钱的.</p>
<p>It is equally relevant when dealing with setbacks, which are inevitable. That is why many people who have had setbacks that seemed devastating at the time ended up as happy as (or even happier than) they were before, once they successfully adapted to them. The faster that one appropriately adapts, the better. As Darwin described, adaptation—i.e., adjusting appropriately to changes in one’s circumstances—is a big part of the evolutionary process, and it is rewarded. </p>
<p>同样相关的是去处理那些不可避免的的挫折,这就是为什么一些人经历了一些毁灭性的灾难到最后可能比原来更幸福了,这是因为他们成功的适应了他们，越快越正确的适应越好,如达尔文所说去适应,根据自己的处境不断地去适应调整去改变,这是进化很重要的一个过程,也会得到回报.</p>
<p>good and bad, depending on their applications.highly creative, goal-oriented people who are good at imagining the big picture often can easily get tripped up on the details of daily life, while highly pragmatic, task-oriented people who are great with the details might not be creative. That is because the ways their minds work make it difficult for them to see both ways of thinking.</p>
<p>是好是坏取决于他们的用途,更高创造性目标(战略)导向的人非常擅长去想象自己想要未来的情景常常容易被日常的生活细节绊倒,同时那些更务实的任务导向的人他们会把每一个细节做得很好通常又没有创造性,这是因为他们的大脑很难去用这两种方式去思考!</p>
<p>The most important quality that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful people is our capacity to learn and adapt to these things.</p>
<p>区别成功的人和暂时没有成功的人是我们有多大程度上去学习和适应这些事情.</p>
<p>man’s brain developed a part that no other species has—the prefrontal cortex. It is the part of the human brain that gives us the ability to reflect and conduct other cognitive thinking. Because of this, people who can objectively reflect on themselves and others—most importantly on what their weaknesses are—can figure out how to get around these weaknesses, can evolve fastest, and can come closer to realizing their potentials than those who can’t.</p>
<p>人类的大脑不用于其他动物特殊的部分是前额的大脑皮质,这能让我们有能力去反省进行其他的认知思考.基于此人们能够客观的根据自己和其他人获得一些反映,最重要的是他们的弱点能够被指出来并且能够超越这些最快的去进化自己,他们能够更加接近去意识到自己的潜能比那些不能正视自己弱点的人.</p>
<p>However, typically defensive, emotional reactions—i.e., ego barriers—stand way of this progress. These reactions take place in the part of the brain called the amygdala. As a result of these reactions, most people don’t like reflecting on their weaknesses even though recognizing them is an essential step toward preventing the problems they cause. Most people especially dislike others exploring their weaknesses because it makes them feel attacked, which produces fight or flight reactions; however, having others help one find one’s weaknesses is essential because it’s very difficult to identify one’s own.</p>
<p>然而被别人指出缺点时通常会防御,感性的反应,自我障碍会在这个过程中成为他们的阻碍,这些表现是由我们大脑中的海马体导致的,大多数人不愿意去反省他们的缺点尽管认出他们是很重要的一个步骤去避免引起问题.很多人尤其不想要让其他人看到自己的弱点,这会让他们觉得被攻击,那会让他们产生攻击或者应激反应,但是那真的是让别人帮助自己发现自己缺点的很重要的途径因为人是很难认清楚自己.</p>
<p>Most people don’t like helping others explore their weaknesses, even though they are willing to talk about them behind their backs, For these reasons most people don’t do a good job of understanding themselves and adapting in order to get what they want most out of life. In my opinion, that is the biggest single problem of mankind because it, more than anything else, impedes people’s abilities to address all other problems and it is probably the greatest source of pain for most people.So it is tragic when people let ego barriers lead them to experience bad outcomes.</p>
<p>很多人不喜欢帮助别人去寻找他们的弱点尽管他们总会在背后议论别人,基于没法认清楚自己缺点的原因人们不能理解自己为什么做不好一个工作，也不能通过不断地调整获得在自己的生活中获得更多,在我看来最大的问题就是人类自以为是超过任何事情,这阻碍了他们去了解并处理所有其他的问题,这对于大多数人而言可能是最大痛苦的来源.这是一个悲剧当人们自我障碍导致他们去承受糟糕的表现.</p>
